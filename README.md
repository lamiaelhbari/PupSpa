# *PupSpa*

*In this challenge, we will put into practice what weâ€™ve just learned about CSS Grid by creating a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. Some of the properties we will use include:*

- `display`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `grid-template-columns`
- `gap`
- `grid-column-start`
- `grid-column-end`

*This will help us structure our layout efficiently while maintaining responsiveness.*
